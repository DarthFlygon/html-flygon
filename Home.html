    <!-- h1-h6 tags are used for headings -->

    <!-- p is used for paragraphs or generally any sort of text.
    br is used to go to next line in a p tag -->

    <p>This is a simple html tutorial. Any data or content that you want to display needs to be written between tags.</p>
    <p>This example is written inside a paragraph tag. I will only use the most important tags needed for this tutorial.</p>
    <p>What if i want to write in a new line instead of starting a new paragrapgh every time? <br>
    Its possible using the br tag.<br>
    What if i want to add an image?<br>
    Lets use the img tag</p>

    <!-- For accessing an image in our file system we give path as shown below.
    Since it is in a folder inside our project we give path like this
    ./ represents files or folders in same folder as this file. -->
    
    <img height="100px" width="100px" src="./images/pikachu.jpg">
    <p>Its possible to give the path for the image from your local system as demonstrated above<br>
    Its also possible to give a link as reference as done below</p>
    <img height="100px" width="100px" src="https://media.wired.com/photos/5f87340d114b38fa1f8339f9/master/w_1600%2Cc_limit/Ideas_Surprised_Pikachu_HD.jpg">
    <p>This is most of html stuff. Now lets make this into an actual webpage instead of this bland stuff here.<br>
    a (anchor) tags are used to setup links to other pages or websites.</p>
